# Feedback Controllers Implementation in Java
This project contains various implementations of feedback controllers in Java. The project was originally created by Professor Nelson Souto of Cin - UFPE in Go, and has been ported to Java for use in a Java environment.

# Overview
The project includes the following feedback controllers:

- On-Off Controller
- On-Off Controller with Deadzone
- On-Off Controller with Hysteresis

Each controller has been implemented as a separate class with its own set of methods to control the feedback loop.
